# Purpose of this project

## Intoduction to New Concepts
  I have been interested in Geo-Data for a while now and decided to give it a try. After learning from a few videos and webpages, I decided to use Folium for this project.
  Through this, I have not only learned how to plot the points and create the interactive map, but also manipulate and replace data to make it easier to create the desired outcome.

## Images of the Map in Action
  Within GitHub, if you are unable to see the map, it may be a result of the browser you are using. Therefore, I have added screenshots here:
